I’m a M.S. student at **Carnegie Mellon University** studying **Automated Science**. Before that, I got my **B.S. in Biomedical Engineering** at the **University of Virginia**.

I’ve worked on many projects spanning synthetic biology as an iGEM team member to single cell RNA-seq analysis. I’ve also developed protocols for liquid handlers and a fully-integrated automated lab setup. I’m super excited about the trajectory of closed-loop laboratory automation and maximizing efficiency in the lab. (Seriously, who wants to be stuck pipetting for hours on end?)

In my free time I love to play guitar, read novels, explore Spotify’s most underrated artists, and work on small front-end projects like this one. Feel free to connect on LinkedIn :)

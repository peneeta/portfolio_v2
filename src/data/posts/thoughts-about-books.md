When I was younger, I used to read all the time. From *Harry Potter* to *A Series of Unfortunate Events*, there were times where I'd spend hours poring over a book. Free time is much more difficult to come by these days, or maybe that's just how I justify the lack of reading I've done since I've left grade school.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

My current trajectory since 2020 has been about 4 to 5 books a year, which is severely below my goal of at least hitting double digits. Here is a small handful of books I've recently finished with my current takes. Bear in mind that I am an engineering student studying computer science and biology, NOT a literature major-- my thoughts are from the perspective of someone who reads for fun and has respect for the craft, but is clearly not an expert. (By the way, I do try to review every book I read on GoodReads to hold myself accountable: [https://www.goodreads.com/peneeta](https://www.goodreads.com/peneeta))

## The Shining - Stephen King
I found a random old copy of this book sitting in my bookshelf (and I mean old-- my copy is a first edition printed in 1976!). I haven't seen the movie adaptation, but I did have a vague sense of what happens in the book: typical ghost story, dysfunctional family, etc., etc. 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

I was legitimately hooked the moment I picked it up. So hooked that I finished it in four days. King does such a great job of detailing the complexity of all of the characters. Each of them has such a rich inner monologue that a movie adaptation cannot capture. The characters feel like real people, each with their own vices and motives. You get to know them as you read. Their backstories and pivotal moments of their lives are unfurled the deeper you get, and as The Overlook tightens its grip on them. 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Usually when I watch a scary movie, there are moments where I'm like "did these people graduate from preschool" and "if they would have done `<insert-action-here>` they could literally escape unharmed". But while reading this book, these thoughts never surfaced. Every action made sense, either because of that character's personality or their backstory, or the constraints placed on them by the external environment.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

I was spooked even though I was just reading words on a page (or maybe I'm just a weakling when it comes to horror as a genre). Loved this and highly recommend!

## Meditations - Marcus Aurelius
In undergrad, taking a philosophy course convinced me to transfer to the engineering school due to the dense writing and the subjective nature of essay grading-- so it's safe to say that I didn't become interested in any kind of philosophy until very recently. 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

I had heard about stoicism through YouTube and was lured in by its accessibility and applicability, which is when I decided to read this book: *Meditations* is a primary source of the core tenets of stoic philosophy put in practice. It differs from other philosophical works because it's so conversational. Like each passage were words spoken to a friend instead of written for academics. In a way they are-- they're the transcribed inner monologues of the most powerful emperor in the world at one point in history.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

There are so many nuggets of wisdom in this book. But out of all of them, I'd say my absolute favorite one is: 

> "If you do the job in a principled way, with diligence, energy and patience, if you keep yourself free of distractions and keep the spirit inside you undamaged-- If you can find fulfillment in what you're doing now, as Nature intended-- then your life will be happy. No one can prevent that."

Perhaps my choice of quote is strongly correlated to me being a Masters student...
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

People have been dealing with hardships of the human experience for hundreds of years-- and they developed tools to cultivate mental strength. If it worked for them, then it can surely work for me. Which means it can work for you too! Take what you want, leave the rest, and save these nuggets internally for when things get rough.

## Ready Player One - Ernest Cline
The librarian checking this book out for me at the library told me that this novel was really good, and she was not wrong. This is a classic underdog story with an insanely intelligent main character told in a very unique voice. Cline does a brilliant job of creating a dystopian technological society that operates inside of a VR universe called the Oasis. The Oasis is a place where you can be anyone you want to be. And its infrastructure is sprawling: school is held virtually, jobs are virtual, and little is done in the real world. 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Reading this book felt like being in a Marvel movie, or any action movie. The characters are so wholesome (it really is a story of *true friendship triumphs all*). It is jam-packed with references to classic arcade games and movies from the 80s (which is well before my time). But even if you don't get all the references, it doesn't take away from the immersion. 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

I usually struggle to relate to dystopian novels because sometimes the society is too fantastical to comprehend--but I found this one to be believable, especially after the COVID pandemic. Suddenly, it's not that far-fetched of an idea for nearly everything to take place virtually with major tech corporations fighting for control over valuable virtual assets... 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

I read this book last year and I am yearning to give this book a second read--it is just too good.

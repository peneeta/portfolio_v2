            <h1>Hi, it's nice to meet you!</h1>
            <p>My name is Peneeta and I’m a M.S. student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Automated Science. Before that, I got my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia. (Go Hoos!)</p>

            <p>I have been involved in many facets of biology from synthetic biology as an iGEM team member to RNA-seq gene expression and pathway analysis.</p>

            <p>I’ve also developed protocols for liquid handlers and a fully-integrated automated lab setup. I’m super excited about the trajectory of closed-loop laboratory automation and highly passionate about maximizing efficiency in the lab. (Seriously, who wants to be stuck pipetting for hours on end?)</p>

            <p>In my free time I love to play guitar, explore Spotify’s most underrated artists, and work on silly little front-end projects like this one. Feel free to connect on LinkedIn :)</p>

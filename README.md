# Portfolio V2 (React + Vite + JavaScript)
Peneeta Wojcik

The second iteration of my portfolio site (visit it here: [www.peneeta.com](www.peneeta.com))

---

## Key changes made since the last iteration
Each time I recreate my website I get a little bit better at it-- here's some of the things I've updated:

- Render text dynamically as components from JSON and markdown files (seriously why wasn't I doing this before...)
- Tailwind CSS styling for easier design and responsiveness (except for the navbar)
- ParticlesJS background for cool molecule effect
- Lottie animations!! Please note that these animations were not created by me: they are available on the lottiefiles website for free. Links to the ones I used are here: [productivity](https://lottiefiles.com/free-animation/girl-working-with-laptop-sitting-on-the-sofa-cQRG0S4nRh) [cute dog](https://lottiefiles.com/free-animation/error-state-dog-EjaOWFukSK)
